1,"Loved it, I can't wait to come back","I loved everything about this museum. The sculpture garden is a great place top sit and relax for a while. The permanent exhibits are spectacular. Although quite crowded, it was never difficult to enjoy the art. Staff are extremely friendly. I'm glad I lived in New York City so that I could visit frequently.",Mar-15,0,1,42,ONCE IN LIFETIME,"One of those trips(once in a lifetime) you've always dreamed of and we weren't disappointed when had the chance to visit on our honeymoon, with the sun in the sky and a little chilly the views were fab and some great pictures to be taken certainly breathtaking.If your in New York make sure this on your list to visit.
